    "#### 1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "**Ans:** An abstract class in Python is typically created to declare a set of methods that must be created in any child class built on top of this abstract class. Similarly, an abstract method is one that doesn't have any implementation. An abstract class/superclass can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. It allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes built from the abstract class. A class which contains one or more abstract methods is called an abstract class. Whereas an abstract method is a method that has a declaration but does not have an implementation"
