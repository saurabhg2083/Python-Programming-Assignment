    "#### Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "**Ans:** Classes in python act as a blueprint based on which objects are created. Objects are the very basis for object-oriented programming. The objects are the real-world entities, and class acts as a template that defines those objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "These real-world entities have behavior associated with them, and classes define that behavior. A class contains variables and functions which act on the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules in Python are files with a .py extension using which we can reuse elements inside that file. When we create a python program, the program may contain inside it functions, variables, and even classes. "

    "#### Q6. How does a Python class handle operator overloading?\n",
    "**Ans:** The operator overloading in Python means provide extended meaning beyond their predefined operational meaning. Such as, we use the \"+\" operator for adding two integers as well as joining two strings or merging two lists. We can achieve this as the \"+\" operator is overloaded by the \"int\" class and \"str\" class. Python Classes handle operator overloading by using special methods called Magic methods. these special methods usually begin and end with __ (double underscore)  \n",
