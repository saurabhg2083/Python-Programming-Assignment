    "#### Q1. Define the relationship between a class and its instances. Is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many partnership, for example?\n",
    "**Ans:** One of the advantages of Object-Oriented programming language is code reuse. This reusability is possible due to the relationship b/w the classes. Object oriented programming generally support 4 types of relationships that are: inheritance , association, composition and aggregation. All these relationship is based on \"is a\" relationship, \"has-a\" relationship and \"part-of\" relationship.\n",

    "Relationship between a class and its instances is a one to many partnership.\n",
    "\n",
    "we can create as many as objects of the class"

    "#### Q3. What kind of knowledge is stored in a class?\n",
    "**Ans:** Class creates a user-defined data structure, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object."

    "**Ans:** The methods with a class can be used to access the insatnce variables of its instance. So,the object's state can be modified by its method. Function can't access the attributes of an instance of a class or can't modify the state of the object."

    "2. Multiple Inheritence\n",
    "3. Multilevel lInheritence\n",

    "#### Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "**Ans:** Encapsulation is used to restrict access to methods and variables. To prevent accidental change, an objects variable can only be changed by an objects method."

    "#### Q7. How do you distinguish between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "**Ans:** Class variables are useful for storing data that is shared among all instances of a class, such as constants or default values. Instance variables are used to store data that is unique to each instance of a class, such as object properties."

    "**Ans:** So SELF should be used when you define an instance method, as it's passed automatically as the first parameter when the method is called. You should also use self in Python when referencing a class attribute from inside an instance method."

    "#### Q10. When is it necessary to use a reflection method? When do you not need it, even though you support the operation in question?\n",
    "**Ans:** Reflection method we often encounter the requirement that a method in the executing object, or a variable in the calling object, or a field of the object should be assigned, while the method name or field name can not be determined when encoding the code, and need to be input in the form of passing strings through parameters."
