    "#### Q1. What is the concept of a metaclass?\n",
    "**Ans:** A metaclass in Python is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. A class is itself an instance of a metaclass. A class in Python defines how the instance of the class will behave. E.g. `int`, `str`, `float`, `list`, `tuple` etc are metaclass type"

    "**Ans:** Metaclasses in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Metaclasses are an OOP concept present in all python code by default. Python provides the functionality to create custom metaclasses by using the keyword type. Type is a metaclass whose instances are classes. Any class created in python is an instance of type metaclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type() function can create classes dynamically as calling type() creates a new instance of type metaclass."

    "#### Q3. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling classes ?\n",

    "\n",
    "Anything you can do with a class decorator, you can of course do with a custom metaclass (just apply the functionality of the \"decorator function\", i.e., the one that takes a class object and modifies it, in the course of the metaclass's __new__ or __init__ that make the class object!-).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you want to make a class object X such that print X (or in Python 3 print(X) of course;-) displays peekaboo!. You cannot possibly do that without a custom metaclass, because the metaclass's override of __str__ is the crucial actor here, i.e., you need a def __str__(cls): return \"peekaboo!\" in the custom metaclass of class X.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same applies to all magic methods, i.e., to all kinds of operations as applied to the class object itself (as opposed to, ones applied to its instances, which use magic methods as defined in the class -- operations on the class object itself use magic methods as defined in the metaclass)."
