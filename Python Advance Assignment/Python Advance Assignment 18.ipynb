    "#### Q1. Describe the differences between text and binary files in a single paragraph.\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "\n",
    "There are mainly two types of data files — text file and binary file. A text file consists of human readable characters, which can be opened by any text editor. On the other hand, binary files are made up of non-human readable characters and symbols, which require specific programs to access its contents."

   "source": [
    "#### Q2. What are some scenarios where using text files will be the better option? When would you like to use binary files instead of text files?\n",
    "**Ans:** It depends a lot on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many types of data, binary representations are much more space-efficient. For instance, you could represent an image as a text file. But any color represented as a 24-bit RGB value in a binary file has to be represented as a six-character code (e.g. FFFFFF for white) in text, which is literally twice as many bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another reason for using binary formats is that they can map directly onto the internal representation of the data that the program is using. If my program uses a complex data structure that’s full of integer, float, and byte values, when I read it in from a text file I have to parse every character of text and interpret it, spending processing time (and writing logic) to figure how to convert the 88 bits in “2983102931,” into the 32-bit integer that the text represents. If I read it from a binary file, the program just copies those 32 bits from the file into memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, text files are binary. It’s not an either/or.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a file encoded as UTF-8 looks like text when you open it in a modern editor, even if it contains Anharic, Hangul, or emojis, That’s what we call “text” today. But open the file in an old editor, one from back when we defined text as one byte = one character, and you’ll see a lot of garbage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In UTF-8, a character may be one, two, three, or four bytes, depending on the Unicode code point that the bytes map to. This is a case of the binary format in the file representing the raw format that the program (the modern text editor) uses."

    "#### Q3. What are some of the issues with using binary operations to read and write a Python integer directly to disc?\n",
    "**Ans:** The read method returns a sequence of bytes as a string. To convert from a string byte-sequence to binary data, use the built-in struct. Binary operations deal with raw data and need to identify how many bytes one would read or write.\n"
